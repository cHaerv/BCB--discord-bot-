# BCB--discord-bot-
This discord bot was built for a friends server there are some in jokes but in functionality it is a bit that replies to people in an english midlands dialect known as "black country".
As a speaker of this dialect I thought it would be brilliant to have a bot that could provide our server with desired functionality and community specific jokes as well.

1.For setup go to https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro and sign in or create an account.
2.Go to applications and select new application and give your bot a name!
3.Give your bot all permissions and also generate a bot token.
4.Go into'main.py' and pase bot token in "client.start(bot_token)". (also delete import from apiKeys as you will not need it)
5.Run your code localy or remotely and type !help in the chat to find all bot commands and cogs.
6.Enjoy!
